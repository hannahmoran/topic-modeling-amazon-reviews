[...]if you are on the fence, do not consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies are done.  if it is oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  do not buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you are already overweight.",0.99770886,"['ohhh la', 'amish country', 'eden organics', 'professionals knock', 'youtube videos', '65 fahrenheit', 'antifungal antibacterial', 'bug bites', 'business practice', 'candida overgrowth']","['it is', '. it', 'i have', ', i', ', and', 'i it', 'i use', 'use it']","['combine eden organics', 'grilled cheese sandwiches', 'sample packs yellow', 'packs yellow gunk', '65 degrees fahrenheit', ': 9:15 mins', 'eye makeup remover', 'professionals still knock', 'shows medium chain', '30 minute meals']","['i use it', '. i use', '. it is', '. i it', '. this is', 'coconut oil .', 'coconut oil i', '. use it']"
