""  to restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. the authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion. further research has shown ""the meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" that is a huge effect. citation is here: lipids. 2010 oct;45(10):893-905. epub 2010 mar 31. saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence. micha r, mozaffarian d. department of epidemiology, harvard school of public health, boston, ma 02115, usa. 3) finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. the majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...]  to summarize what i learned from these conversations and articles, i now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and i know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.  i decided to take the more conservative path and i sold the coconut oil i bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. i hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",0.52327055,"['dr. mercola', 'harvard school', 'school public', 'totally possible', '... ]', '[ ...', '[ ]', 'most convincing', 'coronary heart', 'public health']","['coconut oil', 'chain fats', 'chain saturated', 'disease .', 'of disease', 'risk of', 'the of', '. i']","['[ ... ]', 'school public health', '10 % reduction', ': ... ]', ': [ ...', ': [ ]', 'they have lower', 'is totally possible', '10 risk reduction', 'harvard school of']","['medium chain fats', 'medium chain saturated', 'medium saturated fats', 'of cardiovascular disease', 'of disease .', 'risk cardiovascular disease', 'risk of cardiovascular', 'cardiovascular disease .']"
