[...]if you are on the fence, do not consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies are done.  if it is oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  do not buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you are already overweight.",0.9977088570594788,"['ohhh la', 'chafing pump', 'indeed winner', 'bruise boo', 'surface scrap', 'amish country', 'antifungal antibacterial', 'bug bite', 'candida overgrowth', 'christmas sample']","['use coconut', 'oil use', 'use hair', 'coconut flavor', 'extra virgin', 'also use', 'oil not', 'coconut not']","['shave ohhh la', 'harvard school public', 'mold surface scrap', 'bruise boo fan', 'theater christmas sample', 'flaky foot peel', 'sample yellow gunk', 'surface scrap within', 'avoid premise naturally', 'cut bruise boo']","['coconut oil use', 'extra virgin oil', 'extra virgin coconut', 'extra coconut oil', 'coconut oil not', 'oil coconut oil', 'organic extra virgin', 'love coconut oil']"
