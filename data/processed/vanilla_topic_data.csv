""  to restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. the authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion. further research has shown ""the meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" that is a huge effect. citation is here: lipids. 2010 oct;45(10):893-905. epub 2010 mar 31. saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence. micha r, mozaffarian d. department of epidemiology, harvard school of public health, boston, ma 02115, usa. 3) finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. the majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...]  to summarize what i learned from these conversations and articles, i now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and i know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.  i decided to take the more conservative path and i sold the coconut oil i bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. i hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",0.5232705473899841,"['dr mercola', 'harvard school', 'island dwell', 'school public', 'totally possible', 'low rate', 'cite study', 'coronary heart', 'public health', 'school health']","['chain fat', 'chain saturate', 'cardiovascular disease', 'risk disease', 'fat increase', 'fat risk', 'increase risk', 'medium chain']","['harvard school public', 'often cite study', 'school public health', 'cite study like', 'risk reduction energy', 'study like one', 'low rate disease', 'oil problem book', 'problem book not', 'coronary heart disease']","['increase risk cardiovascular', 'medium chain fat', 'medium chain saturate', 'medium saturate fat', 'risk cardiovascular disease', 'increase cardiovascular disease', 'increase risk disease', 'replace saturate fat']"
