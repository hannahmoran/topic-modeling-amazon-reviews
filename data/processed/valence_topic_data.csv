(those with soda-addicted children are probably looking for the same thing.) that is a tastebud issue as well as one of habit, just like cutting salt out of one's diet is&mdash;you start with more and then lessen the amount you use as your taste buds adjust. but the sucralose sweetener, as it is with many of these flavored-water drinks, is dreadful at any strength, imo.  i know, too, that the idea that sucralose is bad for you is controversial, but the taste of it is not. it has an indisputable chemical taste that i am not fond of. why not stevia instead? or xylitol (with a caution about overconsumption causing diarrhea). the product has to be refrigerated, so why not something other than the shelf-stable sucralose?  finally, i am confused about the ""one squeeze"" claim. i got the impression that this ""one squeeze"" is a measured amount. however, when i did one squeeze in a glass, it did not stop squeezing before i did and i wound up with a glass that was too strongly flavored and yucky. is this how most people like their drinks? there seems to be some kind of control mechanism in the open portion of the cap, and also it looks like there is some kind of straw thing being used in the picture on the bottle. is a straw thing required to measure/control the squeezer? my bottle (just one, for review) did not come with anything like that. so all i can say about it is that the squeeze does not seem to be measured. maybe i misunderstood that it was going to be.",0.995813250541687,"['yada yada..', 'fort knox', 'bike ride', 'deer park', 'gummy worms', 'starbucks grande', '1.5 liter', 'glycemic load', 'risks associated', 'fructose corn']","['it is', '. it', ', i', ', and', ', but', 'i not', ', it', 'is a']","['gum acacia glyceryl', 'acacia glyceryl abietate', 'acai grape pomegranate', 'fructose corn syrup', 'health risks associated', 'length : 0:49', 'length : 1:10', 'stained everything touched', 'specially designed delivers', ': 0:49 mins']","[', it is', 'i do not', '. i am', 'it is not', '. i have', '. the is', '. if you', '. this is']"

[...]if you are on the fence, do not consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies are done.  if it is oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  do not buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you are already overweight.",0.9979655146598816,"['amish country', 'eden organics', 'fits bill', 'professionals knock', 'saut eacute', 'stretch marks', 'vitamin e', 'youtube videos', 'medium chain', 'reasonably priced']","['it is', '. it', ', i', 'i have', ', and', 'i it', 'this is', '. is']","['combine eden organics', 'grilled cheese sandwiches', 'sample packs yellow', 'medium chain acids', 'medium chain fatty', ': 9:15 mins', 'length : 9:15', 'packs yellow gunk', '30 minute meals', 'saut & eacute']","['. i use', 'i use it', '. i it', '. this is', 'coconut oil .', '! ! !', 'of coconut oil', 'coconut oil i']"

""  to restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. the authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion. further research has shown ""the meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" that is a huge effect. citation is here: lipids. 2010 oct;45(10):893-905. epub 2010 mar 31. saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence. micha r, mozaffarian d. department of epidemiology, harvard school of public health, boston, ma 02115, usa. 3) finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. the majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...]  to summarize what i learned from these conversations and articles, i now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and i know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.  i decided to take the more conservative path and i sold the coconut oil i bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. i hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",0.6151183843612671,"['dr. mercola', 'harvard school', 'school public', 'totally possible', '... ]', '[ ...', '[ ]', 'most convincing', 'coronary heart', 'public health']","['coconut oil', 'chain fats', 'chain saturated', 'disease .', 'of disease', 'risk of', 'the of', '. i']","['[ ... ]', 'school public health', '10 % reduction', ': ... ]', ': [ ...', ': [ ]', 'they have lower', 'is totally possible', '10 risk reduction', 'harvard school of']","['medium chain fats', 'medium chain saturated', 'medium saturated fats', 'of cardiovascular disease', 'of disease .', 'risk cardiovascular disease', 'risk of cardiovascular', 'cardiovascular disease .']"
