[...]if you are on the fence, do not consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies are done.  if it is oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  do not buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you are already overweight.",0.9978044629096985,"['amish country', 'bruce fife', 'combine eden', 'eden organics', 'grilled sandwiches', 'head toe', 'lost pounds', 'onion garlic', 'professionals knock', 'saut eacute']","['it is', ', i', 'i have', '. it', ', and', '. the', 'i am', 'i it']","['combine eden organics', 'grilled cheese sandwiches', 'sample packs yellow', 'packs yellow gunk', '30 minute meals', 'greasy gunk combine', 'saut & eacute', 'professionals still knock', 'saut eacute ;', 'through sample packs']","['coconut oil .', '! ! !', 'coconut oil i', 'i use it', '. i use', '. i am', '. i it', 'of coconut oil']"

""  to restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. the authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion. further research has shown ""the meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" that is a huge effect. citation is here: lipids. 2010 oct;45(10):893-905. epub 2010 mar 31. saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence. micha r, mozaffarian d. department of epidemiology, harvard school of public health, boston, ma 02115, usa. 3) finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. the majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...]  to summarize what i learned from these conversations and articles, i now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and i know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.  i decided to take the more conservative path and i sold the coconut oil i bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. i hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",0.776779055595398,"['according experts', 'harvard school', 'important thing', 'link goes', 'school public', 'totally possible', 'dr. dean', 'dr. mercola', 'price ?', 'thing know']","[', and', '? ?', 'saturated fat', '! !', '. i', 'the of', '. the', 'disease .']","[': 9:15 mins', 'length : 9:15', 'business practice !', 'important thing know', 'link above goes', '! please reinstate', 'off now !', 'school public health', 'most important thing', 'thing know about']","['risk of disease', '! ! !', ', , and', 'medium chain fats', 'medium chain saturated', 'medium saturated fats', 'of cardiovascular disease', 'of disease .']"
