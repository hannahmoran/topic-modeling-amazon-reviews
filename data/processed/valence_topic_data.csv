(those with soda-addicted children are probably looking for the same thing.) that is a tastebud issue as well as one of habit, just like cutting salt out of one's diet is&mdash;you start with more and then lessen the amount you use as your taste buds adjust. but the sucralose sweetener, as it is with many of these flavored-water drinks, is dreadful at any strength, imo.  i know, too, that the idea that sucralose is bad for you is controversial, but the taste of it is not. it has an indisputable chemical taste that i am not fond of. why not stevia instead? or xylitol (with a caution about overconsumption causing diarrhea). the product has to be refrigerated, so why not something other than the shelf-stable sucralose?  finally, i am confused about the ""one squeeze"" claim. i got the impression that this ""one squeeze"" is a measured amount. however, when i did one squeeze in a glass, it did not stop squeezing before i did and i wound up with a glass that was too strongly flavored and yucky. is this how most people like their drinks? there seems to be some kind of control mechanism in the open portion of the cap, and also it looks like there is some kind of straw thing being used in the picture on the bottle. is a straw thing required to measure/control the squeezer? my bottle (just one, for review) did not come with anything like that. so all i can say about it is that the squeeze does not seem to be measured. maybe i misunderstood that it was going to be.",0.995813250541687,"['cardboard washer', 'co worker', 'fort knox', 'yada yada', 'bacteria intestine', 'bike ride', 'deer park', 'gummy worm', 'length min', 'photograph post']","['energy drink', 'taste like', 'fruit flavor', 'punch flavor', 'vitamin energy', 'one squeeze', 'squeeze drink', 'squeeze energy']","['photograph post website', 'yada yada yeah', 'acacia glyceryl abietate', 'gum acacia abietate', 'gum acacia glyceryl', 'gum glyceryl abietate', 'rah dose sunshine', 'acai grape pomegranate', 'gatorade contains bvo', 'variety sacrifice fitness']","['squeeze energy drink', 'vitamin energy drink', 'vitamin squeeze drink', 'like fruit punch', 'fruit punch not', 'fruit punch taste', 'like kool aid', 'taste fruit punch']"

[...]if you are on the fence, do not consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies are done.  if it is oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  do not buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you are already overweight.",0.9979655146598816,"['indeed winner', 'surface scrap', 'fit bill', 'saut eacute', 'amish country', 'christmas sample', 'dr dean', 'head toe', 'mold surface', 'mounds concerned']","['oil use', 'use coconut', 'coconut flavor', 'extra virgin', 'oil not', 'coconut not', 'like coconut', 'virgin coconut']","['mold surface scrap', 'surface scrap within', 'avoid premise naturally', 'theater christmas sample', 'sample yellow gunk', 'wipe paper towel', 'steel cut oat', 'gunk combine eden', 'mounds bar concerned', 'premise naturally saturate']","['coconut oil use', 'extra virgin coconut', 'extra virgin oil', 'extra coconut oil', 'coconut oil not', 'organic extra virgin', 'love coconut oil', 'brand coconut oil']"

""  to restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. the authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion. further research has shown ""the meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" that is a huge effect. citation is here: lipids. 2010 oct;45(10):893-905. epub 2010 mar 31. saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence. micha r, mozaffarian d. department of epidemiology, harvard school of public health, boston, ma 02115, usa. 3) finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. the majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...]  to summarize what i learned from these conversations and articles, i now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and i know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.  i decided to take the more conservative path and i sold the coconut oil i bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. i hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",0.6151183843612671,"['dr mercola', 'harvard school', 'island dwell', 'school public', 'totally possible', 'low rate', 'cite study', 'coronary heart', 'public health', 'school health']","['chain fat', 'chain saturate', 'cardiovascular disease', 'risk disease', 'fat increase', 'fat risk', 'increase risk', 'medium chain']","['harvard school public', 'often cite study', 'school public health', 'cite study like', 'risk reduction energy', 'study like one', 'low rate disease', 'oil problem book', 'problem book not', 'coronary heart disease']","['increase risk cardiovascular', 'medium chain fat', 'medium chain saturate', 'medium saturate fat', 'risk cardiovascular disease', 'increase cardiovascular disease', 'increase risk disease', 'replace saturate fat']"
